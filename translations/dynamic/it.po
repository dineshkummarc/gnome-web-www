"companies that require copyright assignment (e.g., MySQL) end up doing most "
"of the work themselves rather than getting real support from the community. "
"Moreover, you can expect conflicts and FUD due to copyright issues. Finally, "
"CA leads to less feeling of ownership by the community which in turn leads "
"to maintenance problems. Bradley Kuhn of the Software Freedom Conservancy "
"and the Free Software Foundation is also generally against copyright "

"copyright assignment offers. It gives them a competitive advantage which "
"makes it easier for them to make money. Meeks agreed that a stronger, "
"broader ecosystem would be great, but copyright assignment defeats the point "
"of Free Software as it creates monopolies. Mark didn’t like to talk about "
"monopolies, as “in terms of access to the code there is no monopoly”, but "

"We spoke with Karen Sandler on this subject afterwards, asking for her "

"later” kind of license effectively commits a contributor to a license they "

"the FSF is the organization which can then incorporate new things with a "
"later version of the GPL. If the code is owned by a strong, independent, "

"goals of the community and the license stay aligned. This trust can be "
"achieved in a number of ways, including assignment agreements that limit how "

"broad membership. However, she opposes assigning the code to a corporate "

"competition already, we don’t need an advantage for a single company. He "

"Groton, MA, November 16 2011: In each of the previous six years, at most one "

"applicants learned first-hand the steps and technology involved in the "
