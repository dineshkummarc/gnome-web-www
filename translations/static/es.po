"My name is Robert Cole. I am twenty-seven years of age and I currently "
"reside in Modesto, California; I was born and raised in a small town in "
"Ohio. I am very interested in computer science and information technology. I "
"will be the holder of an Associate degree in Computer Information Systems as "
"well as a Computer Applications Specialist certificate from Modesto Junior "
"College following this current semester which ends next week. Though it is "
"only an Associate degree, I have high hopes that it will go a long way in "
"showing employers that I am capable of working and of being an asset to "
"whichever of them will give me a chance at a job."

"I was born with a visual defect called microphthalmia, which is a big word "
"that simply means that my eyeballs did not fully develop and are thus about "
"one-third the size of a normal human eyeball. I have no sight at all in my "
"left eye, and I have a visual acuity measurement of 20/2000 in my right eye, "
"which basically means that my vision is very limited. Throughout the "
"duration of my childhood, my mother (who was a single mother who had the "
"task of raising four children including myself) as well as others around me "
"had no idea what to do with me as I was the only visually impaired person "
"(to my knowledge) in the town in which we resided. To say the least about my "
"childhood, my mother did her best to raise us, but we lived well below the "
"poverty level; I had few friends because many of the children my age were "
"afraid to even be around me as I was ‘different’."

"I was introduced to computers in 1998 during my eighth grade year. I felt "

"computer lab. The system ran Windows 98, and I felt like a complete failure "
"because I felt as though I could never use a computer system. I purchased my "
"first computer system (with money which I scrounged up over many months) in "
"2001. This machine ran Windows ME, and it is needless to say…I still felt "
"like I could never use a computer system. As time went on I was introduced "
"to commercial assistive technology software such as the ZoomText screen "
"magnifier (produced by AiSquared) and the JAWS screen reader (produced by "
"Freedom Scientific). I finally felt like I could do something with "
