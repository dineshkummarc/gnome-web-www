I am very interested in computer science and information technology. I will be the holder of an Associate degree in Computer Information Systems as well as a Computer Applications Specialist certificate from Modesto Junior College following this current semester which ends next week. Though it is only an Associate degree, I have high hopes that it will go a long way in showing employers that I am capable of working and of being an asset to whichever of them will give me a chance at a job."

I have no sight at all in my left eye, and I have a visual acuity measurement of 20/2000 in my right eye, which basically means that my vision is very limited. Throughout the duration of my childhood, my mother (who was a single mother who had the task of raising four children including myself) as well as others around me had no idea what to do with me as I was the only visually impaired person (to my knowledge) in the town in which we resided. To say the least about my childhood, my mother did her best to raise us, but we lived well below the poverty level; I had few friends because many of the children my age were afraid to even be around me as I was ‘different’."

The system ran Windows 98, and I felt like a complete failure because I felt as though I could never use a computer system. I purchased my first computer system (with money which I scrounged up over many months) in 2001. This machine ran Windows ME, and it is needless to say…I still felt like I could never use a computer system. As time went on I was introduced to commercial assistive technology software such as the ZoomText screen magnifier (produced by AiSquared) and the JAWS screen reader (produced by Freedom Scientific). I finally felt like I could do something with computers. In 2002, I earned a certification of completion from a local vocational school as well as a Honors Diploma from my local high school."

Thanks the screen magnification available in Gnopernicus I was able to use Fedora Core 5 and I passed the class with a perfect score. During that class I fell in love with Linux and GNOME."

I also use the Compiz Negative plugin in GNOME 2.32 on a Linux Mint 11 system which makes reading much easier on my eyes. Although GNOME 3.x does not work with Compiz, it provides a very good magnification option using the built-in Zoom feature. There is also an inverse contrast feature which is under development; this will make my GNOME 3 experience much more pleasant as I will be able to read with a negative contrast (white text on a black background)."

Accessibility and assistive technologies are very vital as the population of disabled users is rapidly growing. As of 2006, there were roughly over 21 million blind adults in the United States alone. For me that means a lot, as I know what it can be like to want to be able to use a computer system for numerous things, but there is no money available to purchase commercial software (often costing the same as purchasing two or more computer systems). For me, GNU/Linux and GNOME equal freedom, and without all of the hard work which has been put into all of this wonderful software, I would truly be at a loss. This is why further development and maintenance of accessible software is so important to me."
